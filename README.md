# extreme-poverty-prediction

Performing an exploratory data analysis and modeling by utilizing geospatial data and socio-economic indicators to analyse geographic patterns in the global distribution of extreme poverty. The goal was to use predictive machine learning models to identify the characteristics of countries with high proportions of people living in extreme povertyâ€”and the factors that enable populations to escape poverty. The analysis was data-driven and included geographic cluster analyses as well as the identification of key factors influencing poverty. Data from education, gender, health, and global development indicators were used to understand which characteristics correlate with extreme poverty and the escape from it. Based on this, predictive models were developed to serve as decision-support tools for targeted development strategies.
